       <b> The story of Lancelot and Guinevere is a part of the Arthurian legend.</b> It is thought to have been inspired or influenced by that of Tristan and Iseult.
        Just like the latter, Lancelot and Guinevere are adulterous lovers. Guinevere is married to King Arthur who, just like King Mark does not suspect anything at first. 
        He eventually finds out about his wife being unfaithful to him with one of his most loyal knights. The Knights of the Round Table split into two groups, supporting either Arthur or Lancelot.
         After several fierce battles between the two men, Guinevere returns to King Arthur but the destruction of the Round Table enables Mordred to challenge Arthur.
          The legendary king kills his rival but he is mortally wounded. Guinevere devastated for being responsible for the destruction of the Round Table and subsequent Arthur’s downfall enters a convent. 
          Lancelot enters a hermitage and eventually becomes a priest. Both spend the rest of their lives in repentance.
